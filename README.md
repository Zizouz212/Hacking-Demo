# Hacking-Demo
Try it. I promise nothing bad will happen.

##### So what is this?

This demo shows some very simple capabilities of how a hacker can collect information
from a computer, while appearing as a seemingly innocent application. This won't destroy
any existing files, and will use information that is generally available from the 
computer itself. It will also perform screen manipulations, and will also take 
advantage of the `say` command line tool available on Mac OS X.

that you please, but please attribute me.

### Compatibility

This demo requires the need to be run on a Mac OS X computer. JavaFX needs to be installed.
It's probably a good idea to have the latest version of Java anyway :)

##### Specifics

This application will:

- Display a video initially.
- Access the system voice (utilizing the `say` command on Mac OS X)
- Find the username, operating system, and architecture.
- Iterate and display the names of files located in the `/Applications`, `/Desktop` and `/Documents` folders.
- Create temporary files, and store them in a folder, located on the Desktop (This application will also open that folder in a native window). The files will subsequently be deleted.
- Perform manipulations on the Application Window.

This will be an interactive program - it will display text and show video. At the end, there will be facts and statistics to demonstrate the severity of cybercrimes - particularly in the areas of where the technology is used as an instrument to commit. Areas where technology was the target will not be featured as much, due to the lower occurence of such crimes. All information will be Canadian.
